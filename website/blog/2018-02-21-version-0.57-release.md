[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.56...v0.57)

Changes in this release:

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[component\]** Introduced `arez.component.ComponentObservable` so that observers can observe a
  component without observing a particular property. The annotation processor has been enhanced so that
  all the generated components implement this interface.
* **\[component\]** The `AbstractRepository.entities()` no longer needs to use `safeNoTxAction(...)` to avoid
  observing all of the non-disposed entities as `isDisposed()` will no longer observe a component.
