[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.54...v0.55)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed the grammar of the error message when `@ObservableRef` is present but no associated
  `@Observable` is present.
* **\[processor\]** Avoid assigning the `COMPONENT_COMPLETE` value to the `state` field in the constructors of
  the enhanced component subclass if the scheduler is not going to be triggered. This triggers the
  `SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT` warning in findbugs and omitting the assignment has no impact on the behaviour
  of the code at runtime.
