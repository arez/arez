[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.68...v0.69)

Changes in this release:

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Add the build time configuration setting `arez.enable_observer_error_handlers` and default
  it to `true`. Expose the setting as `Arez.areObserverErrorHandlersEnabled()` and update the testing
  infrastructure in the class `ArezTestUtil` to add support for configuring the setting during tests.
  Added assertions to `ArezBuildAsserts` to verify that the `ObserverErrorHandler` classes are stripped
  out of the GWT compiled output when setting is set to `false`. This resulted in a marginally smaller
  output size if the setting is set to `false`.

#### Changed
* The `BuildOutputTest` test has been significantly enhanced to ensure that the result of GWT compilation
  does not include unexpected outputs.
