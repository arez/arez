[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.55...v0.56)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Updated the `isDispose()` method to avoid invoking `reportObserved()` on the `"disposable"`
  observable property if the component is disposed or being disposed.
* **\[processor\]** Suppressed `unchecked` warnings due to casts in the `@Memoize` methods with type parameters
  generated in the enhanced component subclass.
