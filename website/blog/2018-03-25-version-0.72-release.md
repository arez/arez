[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.71...v0.72)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* Ensured that the source code generated by annotation processors is always added to the jar for downstream
  gwt projects. This involved refactoring the usage of annotation processors across the project. The
  `arez-extras` and `arez-browser-extras` should always include generated source in artifacts.

#### Changed
* Upgrade `org.realityforge.braincheck:braincheck:jar` artifact to `1.5.0` which removes the gwt classifier.
* Upgrade `org.realityforge.gir:gir-core:jar` artifact to `0.03`.
* Enhance the `downstream-test` project so that it also builds using the maven build system. These tests are
  designed to ensure that the dependencies as defined in the poms are structure correctly for a Maven project.
