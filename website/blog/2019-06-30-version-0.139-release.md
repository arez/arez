[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.138...v0.139)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.gir` artifact to version `0.10`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `2.24`.
* Decouple from the `com.google.jsinterop:base` artifact, re-add dependency on `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations` and implement the `debugger` javascript statement locally. This reduces the number of upstream dependencies for the project.
