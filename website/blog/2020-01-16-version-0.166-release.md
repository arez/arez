[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.165...v0.166)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `com.squareup` artifact to version `1.12.0`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.proton` artifacts to version `0.16`.
* Fix an invariant failure where a `arez.ComputableValue` instance is created with the `readOutsideTransaction` set to `true` and it is invoked when the build setting `arez.enable_names` is set to `false`.
* Change the annotation processor so that the method annotated with `@PostConstruct` can also be annotated with `@Action`.
* Update the annotation processor to generate an error if the annotation `javax.xml.ws.Action` is ever applied to a class annotated with `@ArezComponent`. This can occur when auto-import in IDEs select this annotation rather than `arez.annotations.Action` which can cause confusion for downstream users.
