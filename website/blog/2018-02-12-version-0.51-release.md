[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.50...v0.51)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** The annotation processor generated multiple catch and throw blocks to handle declared
  exceptions on actions. This resulted in significantly more complex code. The processor was updated to use
  the `multi-catch` feature introduced in Java 7SE to simplify the code.
* **\[processor\]** Enhance the annotation processor to collapse multiple catch blocks in actions and tracked
  observers to reduce code size and simplify generated code.

#### Changed
* Removed the usage of the gwt internal `@ForceInline` annotation. Measurements indicated it had no impact
  on the output size as it was placed on methods that were already considered inline candidates by the GWT
  compiler.
