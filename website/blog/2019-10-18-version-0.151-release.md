[API Differences](/api-diff/?key=arez&old=0.150&new=0.151)

The release includes 1 breaking API change.

Changes in this release:

* Add support for adding `@CascadeDispose` on the same method as the `@Reference` annotation.
* Remove unused method `CollectionsUtil.asSet()`.
* Enhance the `@OnDepsChange` annotation so that methods annotated with this can optionally take an instance of the associated `Observer`. This reduces the complexity of implementing some asynchronous reactions.
* Support a wildcard type parameter in the return type of methods annotated with the `@ObservableValueRef` annotation.
