[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.112...v0.113)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Change the way the Dagger2 factory is defined by switching from a static method using a
  `@Provide` annotation to using an abstract method using a `@Binds` annotation. This results in more optimized
  code being output by the dagger compiler.
* Upgrade the version of javapoet to `1.11.1`.
* Upgrade the Dagger2 support to version `2.19`.
