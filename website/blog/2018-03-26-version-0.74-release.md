[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.73...v0.74)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Fixed a bug where `highPriority` "When" observers would create a normal priority condition
  which would result in an effectively normal priority as the condition will not be recomputed with a high
  priority but even though the observer watching the condition was high priority.

#### Changed
* **\[core\]** Add an invariant that verified that `highPriority` observers can not observer normal
  priority `ComputedValue` instances.
* **\[core\]** Extracted a single instance of "standard" `EqualityComparator` implementation and made it
  available via `EqualityComparator.defaultComparator()`. This reduced the number of synthetic types that
  GWT was forced to create compared to the approach of passing around method references. This reduced
  the codesize a fraction of a `%` in small applications and a larger amount in large applications that
  used many `ComputedValue` instances.
