[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.161...v0.162)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.proton` artifact to version `0.07`.
* Decouple the `processor` artifact from the `com.google.auto:auto-common` dependency and thus the `com.google.guava:guava` dependency. This significantly reduces the build time for the processor and the size of the processor artifact.
