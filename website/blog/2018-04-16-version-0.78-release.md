[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.77...v0.78)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** A package access method annotated with an Arez annotation, in a superclass
  of the `@ArezComponent` that is in a different package would previously generate a compile error
  but now the processor detects this scenario and emits an explicit error rather than generating
  invalid code.

#### Added
* **\[docs\]** Begin the "Project Setup" section of docs.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[\core\]** Move the dependency on `arez-annotations` from `arez-core` to `arez-components` to accurately
  reflect intent.
