[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.109...v0.110)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Add the parameter `writeOutsideTransaction` to the `@Observable` annotation that makes it
  possible to define observable properties that will create an action if they are not already wrapped in
  a transaction. This simplifies scenario where actions are only being created to modify a single
  observable value.
* **\[docs\]** Add some minimal user documentation about `@Reference` and `@Inverse` annotations.
* **\[core\]** Add `<inherits name='arez.Arez'/>` to the `Component.gwt.xml` GWT module so no need
  to explicitly inherit module in downstream applications.
* **\[processor\]** Generate a compile error if an `@Observable` annotated method is abstract and throws
  an exception.
* **\[processor\]** Add the `depType` parameter to the `@Memoize` annotation.
