[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.81...v0.82)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[component\]** Fixed a bug in `AbstractContainer` where the when observer that removes disposed entities
  was not observing the entity and thus was never rescheduled. This resulted in the underlying map containing
  many disposed entities that could not be garbage collected. They were not exposed to the application and
  did not impact application behaviour as methods returning entities checked the disposable state but could
  lead to significant memory leaks over enough time.

#### Changed
* **\[component\]** Change the name of the when observer that removes disposed entities from a
  repository to `[MyRepository].EntityWatcher.[MyEntityId]` from `[MyRepository].Watcher.[MyEntityId]`.
  The rename occurred to improve clarity during debugging.
* **\[component\]** Ensure that the `MemoizeCache` class disposes all created `ComputedValue` instances
  within the scope of a single transaction.
