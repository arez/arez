[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.84...v0.85)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Add utility method `Disposable.isNotDisposed(Object)` that is equivalent to
  `!Disposable.isDisposed(Object)`. This simplifies code that uses stream apy by allowing
  conversion of lambdas into method references.
* Fix bug that resulted in inclusion in the package of the gwt compile output.
* **\[core\]** Remove redundant compile-time check in `Observable.preReportChanged()`.
* **\[core\]** The `DISPOSE` transaction that wraps Arez elements now enforces the constraint
  that it is not possible to change `Observable` values from within the `dispose()` operation.
