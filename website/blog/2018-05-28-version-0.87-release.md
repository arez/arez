[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.86...v0.87)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** `@Observable` properties that return a collection but have no setter were not having
  the cache of the unmodifiable variant cleared. This can not be fixed until it is possible to have an
  `OnChanged` hook on an observable. To fix the problem temporarily, the unmodifiable variant has been
  disabled on `@Observable` properties where the `expectSetter` parameter is set to false.
