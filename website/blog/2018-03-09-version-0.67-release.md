[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.66...v0.67)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* The `ArezTestUtil.checkApiInvariants()` and `ArezTestUtil.noCheckApiInvariants()` were incorrectly setting
  the `checkInvariants` flag rather than the `checkApiInvariants` flag.

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Re-arrange the generated code so that the GWT compiler can eliminate the static `nextId`
  field in generated classes if it is not actually used.
* **\[core\]** Rework `arez.Node` so that the context is derived from the singleton context unless the
  `Arez.areZonesEnabled()` method returns true. This reduces the size of data stored for each reactive component
  in the system.
* **\[core\]** Extract the `arez.ArezContextHolder` class and the `arez.ArezZoneHolder` class from `arez.Arez`
  to hold the state that was previously `arez.Arez` and eliminate the `<clinit>` method on the `arez.Arez` class.
  This allowed further build time optimizations as the GWT compiler could inline the accessors for the build
  time constants.
