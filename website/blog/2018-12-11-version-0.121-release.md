[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.120...v0.121)

Changes in this release:

* Update the release process so that releases of Arez and downstream projects are done by the local machine
  performing the release process rather than delegating to TravisCI. This was done as recent changes to TravisCI
  and/or Maven Central make it impossible to perform this task on the TravisCI build machines.
