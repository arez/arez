[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.74...v0.75)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Fixed a bug where the `LeastStaleObserverState` of an `Observable` could be incorrect during
  `dispose()` invocation of a `ComputedValue` that derives the `Observable`. This does not impact runtime
  correctness in production builds. When hen the `ArezDebug` GWT module is used or invariant checking is
  explicitly enabled by compile time configuration, invariant checks can fail when validating the value of
  the `LeastStaleObserverState` field.
* **\[processor\]** Fixed a bug where a wildcard parameterized observable property with both a setter and a
  getter present where the type parameter is derived from the containing type was being incorrectly identified
  as having different types. This scenario is allowed and a test was added to ensure that it will continue to
  be supported.
* **\[processor\]** Generate an error where the setter or getter of an observable property has a type argument.
  This avoids the scenario where generated code will not compile due to missing type arguments.

#### Changed
* Upgrade the Dagger2 support to version `2.15`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[browser-extras\]** The `IdleStatus` class has been removed from the `arez` project and migrated
  to it's own top level project [arez/arez-idlestatus](https://github.com/arez/arez-idlestatus).
