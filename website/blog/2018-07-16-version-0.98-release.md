[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.97...v0.98)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Fix a long-standing bug that could result in invariant failure when a `READ_WRITE`
  observer (such as an an autorun), triggers a change that will result in rescheduling itself by
  adding a new observable that has `STALE` observers that are waiting to react. The invariant
  failure would be optimized out in production mode and there would be no impact of this bug.
* **\[core\]** Fix message in invariant failure when attempted to remove an `Observer` from
  an `Observable` when the `Observer` was not observing the `Observable`.
* Move to a J2CL compatible variant of the jetbrains annotations.
