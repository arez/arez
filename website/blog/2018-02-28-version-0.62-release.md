[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.61...v0.62)

Changes in this release:

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Add the ability to control the execution environment in which reactions are scheduled by supplying a
  `ReactionEnvironment` instance to `ArezContext`. This makes it easy to interact with other frameworks or toolkits
  that have their own scheduler such as [React4j](https://react4j.github.io). A typically scenario involves pausing
  other schedulers while the Arez scheduler is active or at least putting other schedulers into "batch update" mode.
