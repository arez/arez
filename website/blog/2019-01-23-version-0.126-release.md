[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.125...v0.126)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Allow the `allowEmpty` parameter to be set to `true` in an `@ArezComponent`
  annotated class even when there is arez annotated methods if and only if the `@ArezComponent`
  annotated class is also annotated with either `@javax.annotation.Generated` or
  `@javax.annotation.processing.Generated`. Otherwise downstream generators are required to have
  a deep understanding of the Arez component model to determine whether the parameter is
  acceptable.
