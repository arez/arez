[API Differences](/api-diff/?key=arez&old=0.159&new=0.160)

The release includes 2 non breaking API changes.

Changes in this release:

* Add two new hook methods that are invoked after an `@Inverse` reference is added to a component or before an `@Inverse` reference is removed from a component. These hook methods are designated using the new annotations `@PreInverseRemove` and `@PostInverseAdd`. See the javadocs for full details on how to use the annotations.
* Generate a suppressible warning if a protected constructor appears on an Arez component. The constructor should be either package access or public.
