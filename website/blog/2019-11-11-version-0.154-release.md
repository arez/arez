[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.153...v0.154)

Changes in this release:

* Optimize the code generated for constructors of components that contain a `@ComponentId` annotated method.
* Ensure that whitelisted annotations on `@*Ref` annotated methods are copied to the implementations.
* Ensure the `@*Ref` annotated methods are annotated with `@Nonnull` and `@Override` where appropriate.
* Restrict the annotation processor to only processing classes annotated by `@ArezComponent` for a minor performance improvement.
* Fix several error messages that reported an error about an annotation on a "method" when the annotation was actually attached to a field.
* Change the format of expressions used inside some invariant messages from `"MyString" + (mycondition ? '?' : "SomeString")` to avoid the use of character expression as the later version of JDT used by GWT post-2.8.2 attempts to treat this as an intersection type in some parts of the code which triggers an internal compiler error.
