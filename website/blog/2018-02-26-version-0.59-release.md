[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.58...v0.59)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed bug that resulted in poorly generated code when there was a `@Dependency`
  annotation as well as a `@ComponentNameRef` annotation within the same class.
* **\[processor\]** The observer generated when `@Dependency` annotated methods with `CASCADE` was not associated
  with the native component instance when native components were enabled. This annotation processor now
  generates the required setup code.

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `disposeOnDeactivate` parameter to the `@ArezComponent` annotation. If set to true
  then a component will self-dispose after it has ceased to be observed via the `ComponentObservable.observe()` method.

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Avoid specifying the `nameIncludesId` parameter in generated repository classes if the
  `@Singleton` annotation will be added as it is redundant.
