[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.45...v0.46)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Remove the specialized `OnDispose` hook that was added to Arez components if they had an
  associated `Repository`. Implement the same functionality through the `ArezContext.when(...)` observers
  that observe the `disposed` observable property and remove the entity from the repository when the entity
  is disposed.

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Introduce the methods `ArezContext.noTxAction(...)` and `ArezContext.safeNoTxAction(...)`
  to support suspending the current transaction and running a `Procedure`, `SafeProcedure`, `Function` or
  `SafeFunction`. This is useful when code behaves differently whether a transaction is active or not. In
  particular it is part of the solution for removing `OnDispose` hook on the enhanced component classes
  generated by the annotation processor.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Moved the `ArezExtras.when(*)` static methods to `ArezContext` instance methods. The goal is
  to enable the usage of the `when` syntax in higher level abstractions such as the component model. This
  resulted in the removal of the GWT module `arez.extras.Extras` as there was no longer any code that was
  included in the module.
