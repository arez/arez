[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.133...v0.134)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.gir` artifact to version `0.08`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `1.0.0-b21-6a027d2`.
* **\[core\]** Use `const` rather than `let` for module import to avoid closure compiler warning.
* Use `Js.debugger()` from the `com.google.jsinterop:base` artifact. This avoids the need to explicitly
  allow the `debugger` statement when compiled by closure compiler pass after transpiling via J2CL.
