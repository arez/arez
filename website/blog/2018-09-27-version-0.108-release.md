[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.107...v0.108)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Improve the javadocs descriptions for `arez.Disposable` to bring them inline with latest
  application architecture.
* **\[core\]** Ensure that the `apiInvariant(...)` invocation in `arez.Disposable` is guarded by an
  `Arez.shouldCheckApiInvariants()` check. This improves dead code removal in the GWT2.x compiler.
* **\[core\]** Enhance the `@ComponentDependency` so that it can be applied to final fields.
* **\[processor\]** Generate a compile error if the `@CascadeDispose` and any other arez annotation
  appears on the same method.
* **\[core\]** Cleanup documentation for the `@OnDepsChanged` method to remove references to the
  `@Track` annotation that has been removed.
* **\[core\]** Enhance the `@CascadeDispose` annotation so that it can be applied to final methods.
