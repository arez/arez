[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.60...v0.61)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Changed the generated `cascadeOnDispose` method for collecting dependencies to defer
  accessing the dependency until it is needed. This avoids the scenario where multiple dependencies could
  be disposed when `cascadeOnDispose` is invoked and one of the dependencies derived from disposed
  dependencies.
