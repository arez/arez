Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck` artifact to version `1.23.0`.
* Ensure that the default value for the `arez.enable_observer_error_handlers` compile time configuration setting is the same value (i.e. `true`) in J2CL compiled code, GWT compiled code and in the JRE environment.
* Introduce the `@ComponentStateRef` annotation to enable component authors to get access to the underlying state of the component from within the component.
