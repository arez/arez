[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.40...v0.41)

Changes in this release:

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add a `@Memoize` annotation that supports the creation of observable, memoized methods.
  See the site documentation for further details.

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Fixed sequencing bug where disposing an active `ComputedValue` could lead to an error
  passed to the `ObserverErrorHandler` instances for the `Observer` associated with the `ComputedValue`.
* **\[core\]** Fixed bug where an `ComputedValue` accessed from actions and not observed by an observer
  would not be marked as stale when a dependency was updated. Subsequent accesses would return the stale
  cached value until the `ComputedValue` was observed by an `Observer` and a dependency was changed. The
  fix involved "deactivating" the `ComputedValue` if there was no observers at the end of the transaction.
