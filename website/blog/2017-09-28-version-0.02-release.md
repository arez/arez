Changes in this release:

#### Added
* Initial support for adding a `@Repository` to an arez component that will cause the generation of a paired
  repository for managing instances of the arez component. Minimal javadocs are available on the
  [site](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/annotations/Repository.html) and more advanced
  user documentation is on the way.
