[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.78...v0.79)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed a bug where a `@Computed` annotated method on a superclass in a different
  package would result in a compile error as a method reference was used to reference method rather
  than a lambda.

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** The types generated by the annotation processor are now associated with the
  annotated class and all it's supertypes as a originating elements. These are provided as hints
  to the tool infrastructure to better manage dependencies. In particular incremental compilation
  by IDEs can make use of this to trigger recompilation when necessary.

#### Changed
* **\[\processor\]** Enhanced the error message generated when a method is invoked on a generated
  Arez component and the component is in the wrong state. The error message now includes the name
  of the method being invoked.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[\processor\]** Generate an error if it is detected that a method annotated with `@Autorun`
  has public access. It is expected that no `@Autorun` method should be invoked outside of the
  Arez framework and thus making the method non-public encourages correct usage.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[\processor\]** Add an invariant failure to the methods generated by `@Autorun` annotation
  to ensure they are never directly invoked.
