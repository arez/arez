[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.51...v0.52)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Ensure that `ArezContext.willPropagateSpyEvents()` is used internally rather than chaining
  it with other checks such as `Arez.areSpiesEnabled()` which should be functionally equivalent but confuse
  the GWT compiler so that it can not always perform DCE effectively.
* **\[core\]** Fixed a bug introduced in `v0.50` where the invariant checking was disabled even when the
  `arez.ArezDev` gwt module was included. The fix was to explicitly enable the configuration settings in
  the module.

#### Changed
* **\[core\]** Move the extraction of the configuration setting `arez.logger` to `arez.ArezConfig` to be
  consistent with other configuration settings.
* **\[core\]** Enhanced the `arez.logger` setting to support `"console"` and `"console_js"` values and
  default to `"console_js"` in GWT based applications. This eliminates the need to compile the
  `java.util.logging.*` classes in GWT application if it is not used other than for the Arez library.
