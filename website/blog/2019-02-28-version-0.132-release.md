[API Differences](/api-diff/?key=arez&old=0.131&new=0.132)

Changes in this release:

* Remove the `org.realityforge.braincheck:braincheck:jar` dependency by reimplementing the invariant
  checking code in `arez.Guards`. The dependency has been inlined so it can be adapted to specific
  requirements within Arez.
* **\[core\]** Implement an `ArezTestUtil.setLogger()` that allows the interception and testing of the
  logger during testing.
* **\[core\]** Extract the patterns and codes for invariant messages into `diagnostic_messages.json`
  in preparation for generating documentation for the error messages.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `1.0.0-b19-fb227e3`.
