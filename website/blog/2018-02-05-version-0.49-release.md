[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.48...v0.49)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed bug where abstract interface methods could cause the annotation processor to fail
  if the concrete implementation of the method was present on the type but higher in the hierarchy. This was
  exacerbated when generic types were used. THe failure was `"@ArezComponent target has an abstract method
  not implemented by framework"`.

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Remove the unused nested class `OnDispose` that was added to enhanced component classes.
