[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.90...v0.91)

Changes in this release:

* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Make the annotation processor generate an error if the `deferSchedule`
  parameter is set to true on the `@ArezComponent` annotation but the class has is no methods
  annotated with the `@Autorun` annotation, the `@Dependency` annotation or the
  `@Computed(keepAlive=true)` annotation.
* **\[processor\]** The state field in generated components is used to enforce invariants and to
  determine whether a component is disposed. The annotation processor can avoid updating the state
  field when invariant checking is disabled if the change is only used to check invariants. This
  results in a significant reduction in code size.
