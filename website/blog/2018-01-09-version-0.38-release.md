[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.37...v0.38)

Changes in this release:

#### Changed
* Move from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to generate website.
  The motivation was the better documentation styling and layout offered by Docusaurus.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Make the `Node` constructor package access as it is not intended to be usable outside the
  existing Arez primitives that all exist in the same package.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Make several internal `Node` methods package access rather than protected access as they
  were never intended or able to be used outside the package.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** The access level of classes that do not have a public constructor has been changed to
  package access. The only way that a generate class can have a public access level is if there is at least
  one constructor with public access and the un-enhanced class itself has public access. End-users are expected
  to add a static factory method to the un-enhanced class or another class within the package to create instances
  of the component.
* ðŸ’¥ Rename the packages in the project from `org.realityforge.arez` to `arez`
