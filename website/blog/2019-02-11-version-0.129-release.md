[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.128...v0.129)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Fix bug where the `onActivate` callback for `ComputableValue` instances was when disposing
  the `ComputableValue` instance while it was in an `INACTIVE` state.
* **\[core\]** Fix a bug where a `disposeOnDeactivate=true` component that was deactivated multiple times without
  the dispose task running could generate an invariant failure in development mode and a runtime exception
  in production mode.
* **\[core\]** Expose the flag `Flags.NO_WRAP_TASK` to signal to the framework that it is not necessary to wrap
  a task in exception handling code.
* **\[core\]** Remove the `ArezContext.scheduleDispose(..)` API as the functionality is available in the more
  general purpose `ArezContext.task(...)` API.
* **\[core\]** Add tracking of API changes for the `core` artifact so that breaking changes only occur when
  explicitly acknowledged. API changes are tracked in reports generated per-release in the
  `api-test/src/test/resources/fixtures` directory.
