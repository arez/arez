[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.136...v0.137)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.revapi.diff` artifact to version `0.08`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `2.23`.
* Remove `{@inheritDoc}` as it only explicitly indicates that the default behaviour at the expense of significant visual clutter.
* Add support for marking java interfaces as arez components. The effective impact is that the
  `@ArezComponent` annotation is now supported on interfaces. The downstream user should not see any
  different behaviour between a class-based and interface-based arez component although the code generated
  for the interface-based component is slightly different.
* Enhance the release process so each release that results in API changes is accompanied by an associated report that presents the API differences.
