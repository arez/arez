[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.96...v0.97)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Add the `verifyActionRequired` parameter to the `action(...)`, `safeAction(...)` and
  `when(...)` methods on the `ArezContext`class . Setting this parameter to true will
  generate in invariant failure in development mode if an action has been declared that does not read
  an `observable` or `computed` value or write to an `observable` value within the scope of the action.
  If no reads or writes occur then there is typically no need to wrap the code in an action and thus an
  invariant failure will help eliminate this code. The invariant check can omitted for code where it
  is not possible to verify ahead of time whether an action is required or not.
* **\[core\]** Add the `verifyRequired` parameter to the `Action` annotation that will support configuration
  of the `verifyActionRequired` parameter passed to the underlying action.
* **\[processor\]** Modify the `@Observable` setter in the generated component class to invoke
  `Observable.preReportChanged()` prior to checking whether the new value is equal to the old value. This
  will result in the potential write operation being verified and registered even if the value is the same
  as the existing value and thus no modify action actually occurs. The purpose of this is so that `@Action`
  annotated methods that either specify or default the value of the `verifyRequired` annotation parameter
  to `true` will still register the write and will not generate an invariant failure if that is the only
  arez activity within the scope of the action method.
