[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.82...v0.83)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Make sure the classes generated by the annotation processor support the scenario where
  `Arez.areNamesEnabled()` returns `false` and `Arez.areNativeComponentsEnabled()` returns `true`.
* **\[core\]** Fixed invariant failure message that was missing `Arez-XXXX: ` prefix in the
  `ArezContext.isComponentPresent()` method.
* **\[processor\]** The annotation processor would produce uncompilable code if the un-annotated method of
  an `@Observable` property was package access and in a different package from the class annotated with the
  `@ArezComponent` annotation. This now produces an error message from the annotation processor.

#### Changed
* **\[component\]** Changed the `AbstractContainer` class to add two hook methods `preEntryDispose(...)`
  and `postEntryDispose(...)` that are invoked before and after an entry is disposed. This allows subclasses
  to customize the behaviour if required.
* **\[annotations\]** Removed unnecessary `com.google.gwt.core.Core` inherit from the
  `Annotations.gwt.xml` GWT module.
