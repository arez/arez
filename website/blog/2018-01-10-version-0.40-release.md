[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.39...v0.40)

Changes in this release:

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Stop the annotation processor generating the `[Name]BaseRepositoryExtension`
  interface when generating repositories as it offered limited benefit relative to the complexity
  it introduced.
* **\[processor\]** Always generate the Dagger2 module as a public interface rather than letting
  the components access modifier dictate the access modifier of the dagger module.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `Injectible` constants to improve clarity;
  - `TRUE` renamed to `ENABLE`
  - `FALSE` renamed to `DISABLE`
  - `IF_DETECTED` renamed to `AUTODETECT`
