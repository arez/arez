Changes in this release:

* Remove `arez.Guards` and replace with the equivalent functionality in the `org.realityforge.braincheck:braincheck:jar` artifact. The dependency was originally used by Arez but was inlined in version `0.96` so that the behaviour could customized for Arez. Now that these customizations have been back-ported to `braincheck` there is no longer any valid reason to keep them. Removing the code also means that the `j2cl_library` definition in Bazel can be simplified as it no longer needs to suppress the `checkDebuggerStatement` warning.
