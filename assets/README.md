# Assets

This directory contains the assets used when building the Arez documentation iconography. Each directory
contains assets and their providence is described below.

## draw-io

This folder contains images generated for Arez by DrawIO.

These files can be exported from DrawIO as SVG. We then remove the  DOCTYPE, namespaces and
then replace the width/height attributes on the top level svg element with a `viewbox="0 0 width height"`
and copy the files to the appropriate `includes` directory.

## favicons

The favicons were generated by the [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) tool.

## icons

* **arez.***: These icons were constructed in draw-io and then massaged in a series of svg authoring programs.
