Arez is designed to be a simple, efficient and scalable state management library for
client-side applications that shines no matter how complex the interrelationships are
between elements within the system. It was a re-architecture of an existing library that
has been in production use since ~2001, heavily influenced by [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/).
