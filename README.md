Arez is a simple, efficient and scalable state management library for client-side applications. Arez is powered
by the reactive programming model found in spreadsheets, a dataflow programming model. Arez tracks usage of
observable data and notifies observers when the observable data changes. The library scales from simple, flat
domain models to complex, highly inter-connected graph-like domain models. Arez trades a higher memory usage
for a faster execution speed and better developer experience. Arez is optimized for developer happiness by
eliminating the need to monitor state changes. Instead, applications react to state changes on demand.

Arez is under heavy development, and sometimes the documentation does not keep up to date. However the goal of
the toolkit is to be easy to use, and this includes clear and concise documentation. If something is unclear
please [report it as a bug](https://github.com/arez/arez/issues) because it *is* a bug. If a new user
has a hard time, then we need to fix the problem.

For more information about Arez, please see the [Website](https://arez.github.io/). For the source code

# Credit

* [Stock Software](http://www.stocksoftware.com.au/) for providing significant support in building and maintaining
  Arez. The company was willing take a risk and base their next suite of applications on an idea and the
  bet paid off.

* The toolkit began life as an attempt to port [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) to java. Not all of the Mobx
  primitives made sense in a java world. There were also places where it was felt that we could improve on
  the Mobx model, at least for our environment. The idea of a "port" was soon discarded and Arez became a
  reimplementation of similar concepts. However there are some places (i.e. `Transaction.completeTracking()`)
  where the Mobx heritage is clear. Credit goes to Michel Weststrate and the Mobx team for their clean conceptual
  model and some inspirational talks. Later in the life of Arez, parts of the Mobx documentation acted as
  inspiration or were directly copied and modified (i.e. MobX's [(@)computed](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/computed-decorator.html))
  docs were used to seed `docs/computable_values.md`).
