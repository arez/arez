This library provides additional utilities and introspection tools based on the core Arez spy infrastructure.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use component;

* add the following dependencies into the build system. i.e.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.realityforge.arez.spytools</groupId>
   <artifactId>arez-spytools</artifactId>
   <version>0.77</version>
</dependency>
```

* add the snippet `<inherits name="arez.spytools.browser.BrowserSpyTools"/>` into the .gwt.xml file.

* Use the various spytools classes. The simplest action is just to turn on logging of Arez event to
  the browser console via `BrowserSpyUtil.enableSpyEventLogging()`.
