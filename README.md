[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/arez/arez-testng.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/arez/arez-testng)

This library provides utilities to make writing TestNG tests for Arez-based applications. In
particular it makes it easy to wrap all test methods in an Arez action. It also makes it possible
to fail the test when unexpected observer errors are detected.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use the library;

* add the following dependencies into the build system. i.e.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.realityforge.arez.testng</groupId>
   <artifactId>arez-testng</artifactId>
   <version>0.00</version>
</dependency>
```
