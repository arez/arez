# Change Log

### Unreleased

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Moved the `ArezExtras.when(*)` static methods to `ArezContext` instance methods. The goal is
  to enable the usage of the `when` syntax in higher level abstractions such as the component model.

### [v0.45](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.45) (2018-01-30)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.44...v0.45)

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** The repositories generated by the annotation processor would incorrectly invert the check
  around `Arez.areRepositoryResultsModifiable()` and created modifiable results when this configuration value
  was `false` and unmodifiable results when that configuration value was `true`.
* **\[processor\]** When the annotation processor can not resolve types for extensions, the code would fail
  with a `ClassCastException`. The annotation processor has been updated to report a more user friendly
  exception in this scenario.

#### Added
* ðŸ’¥ **\[components\]** Introduce the `arez.components.Identifiable` interface that is implemented by generated
  component classes and can be used to access the underlying Arez identifier.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[components\]** Removed the `type` parameter from the exception `arez.component.NoSuchEntityException`
  so that Class instances can be optimized away in production code. The parameter provided limited utility and
  was a hold-over from an earlier component system.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[components\]** Introduce the `arez.component.AbstractRepository` class that is used by the annotation
  processor when generating repositories. This reduces the amount of code that is generated, decreases the amount
  of code that is converted to javascript in a GWT application and makes it easier to test the repository code
  in isolation. It also made it possible for extensions to refer to the `AbstractRepository` reducing the
  potential for un-resolvable types when some types are generated by the annotation processor that are used by
  interfaces that the same type implements (i.e. extensions).

### [v0.44](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.44) (2018-01-25)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.43...v0.44)

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** `@OnDepsChanged` method candidates that are not annotated were being incorrectly ignored
  if they had a final modifier. Final modifiers are now accepted.

#### Added
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** An `arez.annotations.Observable` property can now be defined by an abstract getter and an
  abstract setter. Previously the property had to be defined by a concrete getter and a concrete setter. If the
  methods are abstract the annotation processor will generate the methods and a field in the generated subclass.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Classes annotated with the `arez.annotations.ArezComponent` annotation must be abstract
  rather than concrete unless the parameter `allowConcrete` is set to `true`. This eliminates a class of bugs
  resulting from developers instantiating the non-reactive component classes but still expecting the component
  to be reactive.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** The `arez.annotations.*Ref` annotations must only appear on abstract methods. Previously
  these annotations would be placed on methods that throw exceptions or return dummy values with the expectation
  that the generated subclass would override the methods to provide useful functionality. Now that types annotated
  with `@ArezComponent` can be marked as abstract, these methods must now be abstract.

### [v0.43](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.43) (2018-01-24)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.42...v0.43)

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed an annoying bug where certain Arez annotated methods that are marked with the
  `@Deprecated` annotation may result in deprecation warnings being generated by the compiler when compiling
  the enhanced subclasses. These include deprecated methods annotated with `@Action`, `@Observable`, `@Computed`,
  `@OnActivate`, `@OnDeactivate`, `@OnStale`, `@OnDispose`, `@Memoize`, `@Track`, `@OnDepsChanged` and `@Autorun`.
  The fix involved suppressing the warnings at the appropriate places in the generated code.
* **\[processor\]** The enhanced setter for `@Observable` properties, on the generated subclass of Arez components
  will first invoke `Observable.preReportChanged()` before calling setter in the component class to ensure that
  the state is not updated if there is no transaction or the transaction is read-only.
* **\[core\]** Fixed bug that could result in invariant failure when the initial immediate execution of an
  `Observer` that caused itself to be rescheduled. This could happen in `@Autorun` methods in components that
  do not set `deferSchedule` parameter to `true` on the `@ArezComponent` annotation.
* **\[core\]** Fixed a bug in `Transaction` class that resulted in an invariant failure in development mode when a
  `ComputedValue` had a dependency on a `ComputedValue` that had a dependency on a `ComputedValue` and the caller
  was a a read-only `Observer`. The code was incorrectly blocking updates of the cached value for `ComputedValue`
  due to attempting to perform a write in a read-only transaction.
* **\[core\]** Fixed a bug where a `Observable` could be passed as a parameter to `Transaction.queueForDeactivation()`
  when it was already queued for deactivation.
* **\[core\]** Made sure that the action wrapping an autorun reaction has the same name as the containing autorun
  Observer instance.

#### Added
* **\[docs\]** Continue to expand the "Component" documentation.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** The default value of the `nameIncludesId` parameter of the `arez.annotations.ArezComponent`
  is `false` if the class is also annotated with the `javax.inject.Singleton` annotation otherwise the default
  value is `true`. This changes from the original behaviour where the default value was always `true`. This is
  to support the very common use case that singleton components do not need and id as part of the name as there
  is only a single instance.
* **\[core\]** Introduce the method `Observable.preReportChanged()` that checks that it is possible to alter
  the `Observable` in the current transaction. In production mode this will typically be eliminated by the
  optimizer. This method allows the Arez application to check pre-conditions prior to altering Arez state to
  eliminate the scenario where state changes have not be correctly propagated.
* **\[core\]** Pending deactivations occur in the reverse order in which they were queued. This results in less
  copying whilst deactivations are being processed.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `arez.annotations.ComponentName` class to `arez.annotations.ComponentNameRef`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `arez.annotations.ComponentTypeName` class to `arez.annotations.ComponentTypeNameRef`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Replace the usage of `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` with `arez.annotations.PostConstruct`
  and generated an error if `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` is used from within an Arez component. The goal is to
  simplify documentation of `PostConstruct` annotation and reduce the places that users need to look to understand
  the Arez component model.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** The default value of the `mutation` parameter on the `arez.annotations.Track` and
  `arez.annotations.Autorun` annotations has changed to false. This is primarily to reflect the fact that observers
  produce effects from Arez state and are not typically used to generate actions or changes.

### [v0.42](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.42) (2018-01-11)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.41...v0.42)

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `arez.annotations.Injectible` class to `arez.annotations.Feature` to
  follow conventions in other projects.

### [v0.41](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.41) (2018-01-11)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.40...v0.41)

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add a `@Memoize` annotation that supports the creation of observable, memoized methods.
  See the site documentation for further details.

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Fixed sequencing bug where disposing an active `ComputedValue` could lead to an error
  passed to the `ObserverErrorHandler` instances for the `Observer` associated with the `ComputedValue`.
* **\[core\]** Fixed bug where an `ComputedValue` accessed from actions and not observed by an observer
  would not be marked as stale when a dependency was updated. Subsequent accesses would return the stale
  cached value until the `ComputedValue` was observed by an `Observer` and a dependency was changed. The
  fix involved "deactivating" the `ComputedValue` if there was no observers at the end of the transaction.

### [v0.40](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.40) (2018-01-10)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.39...v0.40)

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Stop the annotation processor generating the `[Name]BaseRepositoryExtension`
  interface when generating repositories as it offered limited benefit relative to the complexity
  it introduced.
* **\[processor\]** Always generate the Dagger2 module as a public interface rather than letting
  the components access modifier dictate the access modifier of the dagger module.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `Injectible` constants to improve clarity;
  - `TRUE` renamed to `ENABLE`
  - `FALSE` renamed to `DISABLE`
  - `IF_DETECTED` renamed to `AUTODETECT`

### [v0.39](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.39) (2018-01-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.38...v0.39)

#### Fixed
* Ensure that the source of the annotation generated artifacts is included in the `extras` and
  `browser-extras` gwt classifier artifact.

### [v0.38](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.38) (2018-01-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.37...v0.38)

#### Changed
* Move from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to generate website.
  The motivation was the better documentation styling and layout offered by Docusaurus.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Make the `Node` constructor package access as it is not intended to be usable outside the
  existing Arez primitives that all exist in the same package.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Make several internal `Node` methods package access rather than protected access as they
  were never intended or able to be used outside the package.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** The access level of classes that do not have a public constructor has been changed to
  package access. The only way that a generate class can have a public access level is if there is at least
  one constructor with public access and the un-enhanced class itself has public access. End-users are expected
  to add a static factory method to the un-enhanced class or another class within the package to create instances
  of the component.
* ðŸ’¥ Rename the packages in the project from `org.realityforge.arez` to `arez`

### [v0.37](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.37) (2017-12-18)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.36...v0.37)

#### Added
* **\[docs\]** Add expected "Code of Conduct" documentation.

#### Changed
* Change the publish task so that it only publishes tag as an artifact if the tag is on the master branch.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade `com.google.jsinterop:base` library to version `1.0.0-RC1`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade `com.google.elemental2:*` libraries to version `1.0.0-RC1`.

### [v0.36](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.36) (2017-12-13)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.35...v0.36)

#### Added
* **\[docs\]** Add initial documentation about integrating Arez components into dependency injection
  frameworks such as [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger) and [GIN](https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-gin/).

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Use the same mechanisms for building the dagger module between the component and the
  associated repository type.

### [v0.35](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.35) (2017-12-12)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.34...v0.35)

#### Added
* **\[processor\]** Add a `dagger` parameter to `@ArezComponent` that controls whether a dagger module
  is generated for a component. The default value of parameter is `IF_DETECTED` which will generate a
  dagger module if the component is annotated with a "scope" annotation and the class `dagger.Module`
  is present on the compile path of the annotated class. A "scope" annotation is an annotation that is
  itself annotated with the `javax.inject.Scope` annotation.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Change the type of the `inject` parameter on the `@ArezComponent` and `@Repository`
  annotations and the `dagger` parameter of the `@Repository` annotation to support `TRUE`, `FALSE` and
  `IF_DETECTED` values. The `IF_DETECTED` value will result in the annotation processor using heuristics
  to determine if the feature is required. See the javadocs for the specific heuristics for each parameter.

### [v0.34](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.34) (2017-12-10)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.33...v0.34)

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Add methods on the `Spy` interface that converts from core objects to the equivalent spy specific
  info object. i.e. `Spy.asComponentInfo(Component)`

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Add invariant check to ensure that the `Observer` does not accept a `TransactionMode` parameter
  if `Arez.enforceTransactionType()` returns false.
* **\[gwt-examples\]** Fix html launch page for for `IntervalTickerExample`.
* **\[gwt-examples\]** Fix code in `TimedDisposerExample` to avoid invariant failures when timer is disposed.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Introduce `ObservableInfo` interface that is used from within the spy subsystem. This change
  effectively removes the `dispose()` method from the public interface of Observables accessed solely through
  the spy subsystem.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Introduce `ComputedValueInfo` interface that is used from within the spy subsystem. This change
  effectively removes the `dispose()` method from the public interface of ComputedValues accessed solely through
  the spy subsystem.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations` library to version `1.0.2`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade `com.google.jsinterop:base` library to version `1.0.0-beta-3`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade `com.google.elemental2:*` libraries to version `1.0.0-beta-3`.

### [v0.33](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.33) (2017-12-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.32...v0.33)

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Ensure that `@Observable` properties can have a parameterized type.
* **\[core\]** Ensure that `@ObservableRef` can be used for `@Observable` properties with a parameterized type.
* **\[core\]** Update javadoc annotations to remove warnings about undocumented parameters and return types.

### [v0.32](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.32) (2017-12-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.31...v0.32)

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `deferSchedule` boolean parameter to the `@ArezComponent` annotation to avoid
  scheduling autorun actions at the end of the constructor in generated component classes.

### [v0.31](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.31) (2017-12-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.30...v0.31)

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add an `inject` parameter to `@ArezComponent` annotation that will add a
  `@javax.inject.Inject` annotation on the generated classes constructor if set to true.
* **\[annotations\]** Add an `inject` parameter to `@Repository` annotation that will add a
  `@javax.inject.Inject` annotation on the generated Arez repository implementation if set to true.
  The parameter will default to the same value as the `dagger` parameter.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Introduce `ElementInfo` spy interface and change `ComponentInfo` interface to extend it
  rather than `Disposable`. This has the effect of removing the `dispose()` method from the public interface
  of `ComponentInfo`
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Introduce `ObserverInfo` interface that is used from within the spy subsystem. This change
  effectively removes the `dispose()` method from the public interface of Observers accessed solely through
  the spy subsystem.
* **\[core\]** Implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` on `ComponentInfoImpl`.
* Upgrade Buildr to version 1.5.4.

### [v0.30](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.30) (2017-11-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.29...v0.30)

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Shade the processor dependencies so that the only jar required during annotation processing
  is the annotation processor jar. This eliminates the possibility of processorpath conflicts causing issues in
  the future.

### [v0.29](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.29) (2017-11-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.28...v0.29)

#### Added
* **\[core\]** The `ObservableChangedEvent` spy event will now emit the value of the observable if
  property introspectors are enabled and the observable has an accessor introspector.
* **\[browser-extras\]** Enhance the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` to log the value field of the
  `ObservableChangedEvent` spy event if it has been supplied.

#### Fixed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** The accessor introspector for `ComputedValue` attempted to recalculate the value when accessing
  value which required that the caller was running a transaction and would cause the caller to observe the
  `ComputedValue`. This differed to normal accessors on `Observable` instances that retrieved the value outside of
  a transaction. The `ComputedValue` was changed to align with the behaviour of normal `Observable` instances and
  will access the current value of the property without trying to recalculate the value.

### [v0.28](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.28) (2017-11-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.27...v0.28)

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Remove the direct dependency on the `javax.annotation.Nonnull` and
  `javax.annotation.Nullable` annotations from the `arez-processor` artifact.
* **\[processor\]** Fix incorrect nullability annotation on `context` field in enhanced component classes.

### [v0.27](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.27) (2017-11-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.26...v0.27)

#### Added
* **\[browser-extras\]** Enhance `NetworkStatus` component so that it exposes an observable property
  `lastChangedAt` that exposes the time at which online status last changed.
* **\[annotations\]** Add boolean parameter `dagger` to `@Repository` annotation that defaults to false. If
  the `dagger` parameter is set to true then a [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger) module will be
  generated for the generated repository class.
* **\[docs\]** Define a placeholder Logo for project and add favicon support to website.
* **\[docs\]** Move the documentation to a separate repository `https://github.com/arez/arez.github.io` so
  that it is published to `https://arez.github.io` rather than `https://arez.github.io/arez`.
* **\[docs\]** Add basic documentation of repositories.
* **\[core\]** Expose the method `ArezContext.isTransactionActive()` with public access.
* **\[processor\]** Treat the `Disposable.isDisposed()` method on enhanced component classes as "optionally"
  observable. If a transaction is currently active then it is treated as observable otherwise it is treated
  as a non-observable property.

#### Fixed
* **\[annotations\]** Fix the documentation on `@OnDepsChanged` annotation to correctly describe the default
  naming convention.
* **\[processor\]** Enhance the processor to remove the direct dependency on the `arez-component` and
  `arez-annotations` artifact. If the `arez-processor` is added to a separate `-processorpath` during
  compilation, the `arez-component` no longer needs to be added to the `-processorpath`.

#### Changed
* Upgrade the version of javapoet to 1.8.0.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Changed the naming convention of the classes generated from nested static classes.
  Previously the name components were separated by a `$` but this is the same convention that is used by
  nested classes and thus a nested class could have aname collision with a generated class. Instead the
  `_` character has been used to separate name components.
* **\[processor\]** Change the enhanced component classes to not cache the `ArezContext` in single zone
  systems. Instead single-zone systems use `Arez.context()` to get the context which allows GWT/GCC to
  identify the `context` field as unused and eliminate it.

### [v0.26](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.26) (2017-11-14)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.25...v0.26)

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ Move arez from `https://github.com/realityforge/arez` to own organization `https://github.com/arez/arez`.

### [v0.25](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.25) (2017-11-08)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.24...v0.25)

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** When exceptions are thrown when calculating the value for `ComputedValue`, the `ComputedValue`
  was marked as in error and a null was returned to the caller. This could mislead the observer into thinking
  that the state was valid and/or may lead to hard to track down errors such as `NullPointerException`s when
  the components cast the result of `ComputedValue` to a primitive value. This has been fixed so that if a
  computation results in an exception then this exception will be cached for the `ComputedValue` and thrown
  for the caller to handle. Subsequent invocations of `ComputedValue.get()` will re-throw the same exception
  if the `ComputedValue` is still in a state of `UP_TO_DATE`. If the `ComputedValue` invokes compute again
  and produces another exception then the toolkit assumes that the `ComputedValue` is in the same error state
  and does not transition dependencies from `POSSIBLY_STALE` to `STALE`.
* **\[extras\]** Ensure that the `dispose()` method on `org.realityforge.arez.extras.Watcher` is performed in a
  single transaction. This makes sure that the `Watcher` does not react whilst partially disposed.
* **\[core\]** Ensure that `ComputedValue.dispose()` never attempts to dispose value multiple times by moving
  the setting of the `_disposed` flag to the top of the method.
* **\[core\]** If an `Observable` is disposed that is a derivation of a `ComputedValue` then avoid generating a
  `ObservableDisposedEvent` spy event aso the `ComputedValueDisposedEvent` is sufficient to indicate that it
  is being disposed.
* **\[core\]** When disposing a `ComputedValue`, ensure the spy event indicating it has been disposes is disposed
  prior to disposing the associated `Observer` and `Observable`.
* **\[core\]** If an `Observable` is disposed that is a derivation of a `ComputedValue` then ensure that the
  associated `Observer` and `ComputedValue` are also disposed.
* **\[core\]** Move the code that propagates the spy event when a `Observable` is disposed outside of the
  transaction so that event ordering is consistent across different scenarios.
* **\[core\]** Always wrap the `Observable.dispose()` method in it's own transaction, regardless of whether there
  is currently a transaction active.
* **\[annotations\]** Made sure that the return value from an `@ObservableRef` annotated method could accept a
  type parameter. The bug was introduced in v0.23 when `Observable` started to take a type parameter but the annotation
  processing code had not been updated to reflect change.
* **\[core\]** Fix the generics on the `ArezContext.createObservable(...)` methods to pass the type parameter to
  observable and make sure the type parameter is documented.
* **\[annotations\]** Enforced naming convention for `type` parameter of the `@ArezComponent` annotation.

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Add the `ArezContext.createObservable()` method that will synthesize the observable name if
  names are enabled.
* Update the release process so that every release creates a "Github Release" and any open milestone that
  matches the release is closed.
* **\[core\]** Introduce the concept of [Native Components](https://arez.github.io/docs/native_components.html). Native
  components allow the explicit representation of components within the core of Arez. This is in contrast to the
  implicit representation of components that already exists as a result of the `@ArezComponent` annotation and the
  annotation processor. Native components can be enabled or disabled at compile time and if disabled will have no
  performance impact. Native components make it possible to introspect the component structure at runtime. This
  feature is designed to enable the construction of DevTools and as such native components are enabled by default
  in development mode and disabled in production mode.
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `@ComputedValueRef` annotation to allow the reactive component to get access to
  the underling `ComputedValue` instance for a `@Computed` annotated property. This is useful for framework authors
  who need access to low level primitives but still want to make use of the arez component model.
* **\[core\]** Expose the `Observable` and `ComputedValue` property introspectors introduced in v0.23 via the spy
  interface. This is designed to enable the ability to write DevTools that introspects these values.
* **\[core\]** Define registries for all instances of `Observer`, `Observable` and `ComputedValue` that are not
  contained by a `Component`. These registries are exposed via the spy interface. As the registries add significant
  overhead, provide a configuration setting `arez.enable_registries` that is disabled by default but is enabled
  in development mode.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Actually remove `disposable` parameter from the `@ArezComponent` as v0.24 just removed
  all the associated functionality and made the parameter ignored.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Changed the type of the first parameter of `ObserverErrorHandler.onObserverError` from `Node`
  to `Observer`. It was originally `Node` as `Observer` was a package private type but now that `Observer` is public
  it can be exposed as part of the public API.
* **\[extras\]** Changed the `org.realityforge.arez.extras.Watcher` class from being a handcrafted reactive component
  to being a class annotated with `@ArezComponent` and managed using the standard reactive infrastructure.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[extras\]** Stopped the `org.realityforge.arez.extras.Watcher` class from extending `Node` as it is really
  a component rather than a node. This means that the `ArezExtras.when(...)` functions need to return a `Disposable`
  rather than a `Node`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[extras\]** Changed the effect of the `Watcher` class from type `Procedure` to `SafeProcedure` as it is not
  expected to throw an exception as it would be swallowed by the framework. This forces the toolkit users to handle
  any error scenarios explicitly.
* **\[core\]** Change the invariant for enforcing transaction type from an `invariant` to a `apiInvariant` so that
  can disable invariants but keep apiInvariants enabled and still invariant. This is useful for downstream consumers.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Remove `singleton` parameter from the `@ArezComponent` annotation. The only valid use case
  was to control whether the names generated in enhanced component classes included the id of the component in the
  name. It significantly increased the complexity of code in generators as there was two separate code paths, one for
  when `singleton=true` and one for where `singleton=false`. It was also used to stop toolkit users from using
  certain annotations when `singleton=true` (i.e. You could not use `@ContainerId`, `@ContainerName`, `@Repository`).
  These were arbitrary design decisions and the constraint has been removed. The enhanced component classes will now
  always generate name helper methods and a synthetic component id if none has been specified. This has simplified
  the annotation processor and the generated code. To restore the ability to elide the id from the component name,
  the parameter `nameIncludesId=false` is now supported on the `@ArezComponent` annotation.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename `name` parameter on `@ArezComponent` to `type` to correctly reflect semantics.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Removed the `Zone.activate()` and `Zone.deactivate()` methods and replace them with
  `Zone.run(Procedure)`, `Zone.run(Function)`, `Zone.safeRun(SafeProcedure)` and `Zone.safeRun(SafeFunction)` as
  these methods eliminate the need to correct pair activate and deactivate calls.

### [v0.24](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.24) (2017-11-02)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.23...v0.24)

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Remove `disposable` parameter from the `@ArezComponent` annotation as all generated
  components should implement `Disposable`. Not doing so can lead to memory leaks.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Change the default value of the compile time property `arez.logger` to be derived from the
  `arez.environment` setting. If `arez.environment` is `production` then `arez.logger` is set to `jul` and a
  `java.util.Logger` based implementation is used. If `arez.environment` is `development` then a proxy based
  version is used, that is useful during testing. Specify the property in `Arez.gwt.xml` so that GWT compiles
  will treat it as a compile time constant and default it to `jul.`

### [v0.23](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.23) (2017-11-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.22...v0.23)

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Add the `ArezContext.pauseScheduler()` method that allows the developer to manually pause
  reactions and `ArezContext.isSchedulerPaused()` to determine if the scheduler is paused. This gives the
  toolkit user the ability to manually batch actions so application can react to the changes once.

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Invariant failures could refer to `ArezConfig.enableNames()` which is a package access internal
  API. Update messages to use public API `Arez.areNamesEnabled()`. Also update internal code to use public API
  where appropriate.
* **\[core\]** Invariant failures could refer to `ArezConfig.enableSpy()` which is a package access internal
  API. Update messages to use public API `Arez.areSpiesEnabled()`. Also update internal code to use public API
  where appropriate.
* **\[core\]** Avoid referencing `TransactionMode` if `ArezConfig.enforceTransactionType()` returns false. The
  dispose actions had been implemented without taking this into account.
* **\[core\]** `ArezTestUtil` could still modify settings when in production mode if assertions were disabled.
  Explicitly disable this by throwing an exception after assertion so settings will never be modified in
  production mode.
* **\[core\]** Ensured that `arez.enable_spies` is a compile time constant by adding it to the `.gwt.xml`
  modules. This was previously omitted which could lead to inconsistent behaviour.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Enhance `Observable` to accept accessors and mutators during construction. These accessors
  and mutators allow introspection of the `Observable` at runtime. These are primarily aimed at supporting
  development time tooling and should be optimized away during production builds. To enable this `Observable`
  needs to be defined with a type parameter and the `ArezContext.createObservable(...)` needed to be updated
  to support this use-case. This capability should be compiled out if `Arez.arePropertyIntrospectorsEnabled()`
  returns false and this is controlled by the gwt configuration property `"arez.enable_property_introspection"`.
  The annotation processor has also been updated to supply the accessor and mutator (if a setter has been
  defined) to the `Observable` iff `Arez.arePropertyIntrospectorsEnabled()` returns true.
* **\[processor\]** Consistently prefix field access with `this.` in generated component classes.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Replaced all usages of `ArezTestUtil.set*(boolean)` with a pair of methods that enable or
  disable a setting. Ensured all of the names of configuration used in `ArezTestUtil` align with names used
  by `Arez` to refer to same setting.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Rename and invert compile time setting from `arez.repositories_return_immutables` to
  `arez.repositories_results_modifiable` and expose it via `Arez.areRepositoryResultsModifiable()` and allow
  configuration during development via `ArezTestUtil`. The annotation processor was updated to use
  `Arez.areRepositoryResultsModifiable()` when generating repositories.

### [v0.22](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.22) (2017-10-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.21...v0.22)

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `@ObserverRef` annotation to allow the reactive component to get access to
  the underling `Observer` instance for either a `@Track` or `@Autorun` annotated method. This is useful for
  framework authors who need access to low level primitives but still want to make use of the arez component
  model.

#### Fixed
* Fixed bug where the annotation processor was not copying the documented annotations from the method annotated
  with the `@ContextRef` annotation to the overriding method in generated subclass.
* Fixed bug where the source code generated for `@Tracked` methods would fail if the `@OnDepsChanged` method
  is protected access and in a different package.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Renamed the `@OnDepsUpdated` annotation to `@OnDepsChanged` to reflect nomenclature
  used through the rest of the toolkit.

### [v0.21](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.21) (2017-10-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.20...v0.21)

#### Fixed
* Fixed bug where the annotation processor was not copying the access modifiers from the method annotated with the
  `@ContextRef` annotation to the overriding method in generated subclass.

### [v0.20](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.20) (2017-10-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.19...v0.20)

#### Added
* Added support for `@ContextRef` annotation that marks a method as returning the `ArezContext` that the
  generated subclass is using.

### [v0.19](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.19) (2017-10-27)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.18...v0.19)

#### Added
* Introduce the concept of a [`Zone`](https://arez.github.io/docs/zones.html) which is an isolated Arez context.
* Add some cute icons to start of "computed" messages and "scheduled" messages in `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor`.
  These were source from the [mobx-devtools](https://github.com/andykog/mobx-devtools) project.
* Add support for interleaving transactions from different instances of `ArezContext`. Beginning a transaction
  in one context will suspend the active transaction even if it is from a different context. The goal is to
  enable isolation between multiple contexts running within the same application.
* **\[core\]** Introduced `ArezTestUtil.resetConfig(boolean productionMode)` to simplify test setup.

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed bug where disposable of an arez component did not wrap all the dispose actions in
  a single transaction which could result in the `dispose()` causing an observer on the component to react
  when it is partially disposed which often causes failures.
* **\[processor\]** Ensure that the types of the setter and getter for an `@Observable` property are the
  same. Otherwise the overridden setter method method will call `Objects.equal(...)` on values of incompatible
  types which would always be "not equal". If a developer desires different types on the setter and getter they
  can use a package access setter or getter that matches paired methods type and then expose another method that
  is not annotated with `@Observable` to transform to the desired type.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Made the `ArezContext` constructors package access so that developers are forced to access
  contexts through the `org.realityforge.arez.Arez` class.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Move `ArezContext.areNamesEnabled()` to `Arez.areNamesEnabled()`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Move `ArezContext.areSpiesEnabled()` to `Arez.areSpiesEnabled()`.
* Upgrade to BrainCheck 1.3.0 so assertion failures open the debugger.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Remove `Arez.bindProvider()` and all associated support infrastructure. Explicitly binding
  providers did not give enough flexibility to implement the desired features (i.e. `Zones` and thread-local
  `ArezContext` instances) so remove it until a suitable alternative can be found.
* **\[core\]** Remove `@Unsupported` annotation from `org.realityforge.arez.Arez` as it is now stable.

### [v0.18](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.18) (2017-10-23)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.17...v0.18)

#### Added
* Added the class `org.realityforge.arez.ArezTestUtil` that exposes methods that simplify testing `Arez` in
  downstream consumers. It exposes mechanisms already used within the Arez library, that were previously
  restricted to use within Arez.

#### Changed
* **\[core\]** Expose the method `ArezContext.generateNodeName(...)` to make it easier for downstream libraries
  to generate names for reactive components. Update `ArezExtras` class to make use of this method and remove
  local name generation methods.
* **\[processor\]** Enhanced the processor so that disposable entities that are created by a repository will
  be removed from the repository if they are disposed directly by invoking `Disposable.dispose( entity )` or
  similar.

### [v0.17](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.17) (2017-10-23)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.16...v0.17)

#### Changed
* Move to GWT 2.8.2.
* Use a separate color in `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` for "computed" related events.

### [v0.16](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.16) (2017-10-19)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.15...v0.16)

#### Added
* **\[component\]** Introduce the "component" module that provides supporting infrastructure for the components
  and repositories generated by the annotation processor. This module is seeded by code from the downstream
  projects that they have needed to support their requirements.
* **\[processor\]** Add a method `getByQuery()` to the generated repository that throws the exception `NoResultException`
  if unable to find a component that matches query.
* **\[processor\]** Add a method `getBy[ComponentId]()` to the generated repository that throws the exception
  `NoSuchEntityException` if unable to component with specified id.

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Eliminate assertion failures when `ArezConfig.enforceTransactionType()` is set to false but
  invariant checking is still enabled. Add a basic integration test with `enforceTransactionType` to to false
  to ensure that this continues to work into the future.
* **\[core\]** Stop recording `TransactionMode` if `ArezConfig.enforceTransactionType()` returns false. This
  results in the code being optimized out in production builds.
* **\[processor\]** Fix annotation processor so that repositories of components with protected constructors
  will not cause a compile error. The fix was to ensure that the access modifiers of the `create` method
  matched the access modifiers of the target constructor.

### [v0.15](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.15) (2017-10-18)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.14...v0.15)

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Repositories that define a `create` method with no parameters no longer suffix the name with
  a "_" character.
* **\[processor\]** Repositories will call `reportObserved()` in the generated `findBy[Id]` and `contains` methods.
* **\[processor\]** The "entities" observable that is defined as part of the generated repository will now be disposed
  correctly when the repository is disposed.

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `@ObservableRef` annotation to allow the reactive component to get access to
  the underling `Observable` instance. This is useful for framework authors who need access to low level
  primitives but still want to make use of the arez component model.
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `expectSetter` parameter to the `@Observable` annotation to support defining reactive
  components with observable properties but no explicit setter. This is useful in combination with the `@ObservableRef`
  annotation to more precisely control how change is detected and when it is propagated. If the `expectSetter`
  parameter is set to false then a `@ObservableRef` must be defined for observable property.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** The `destroy` method in repositories have been annotated with `@Action` to avoid the need for
  defining an action separately.
* **\[processor\]** Accessing a component after it has been disposed results in an Braincheck invariant
  failure rather than an assert failure. This means a more meaningful message can be presented to the developer.
* **\[processor\]** Generated repositories have been reworked to make use of `@ObservableRef` and
  `@Observable(expectSetter = false)` features to simplify code and make it consistent with downstream code.

### [v0.14](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.14) (2017-10-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.13...v0.14)

#### Added
* **\[browser-extras\]** Introduce the `BrowserSpyUtil` util class that helps enabling and disabling a
  singleton console logging spy.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[extras\]** Moved `WhyRun` from the package `org.realityforge.arez.extras` to `org.realityforge.arez.extras.spy`.

### [v0.13](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.13) (2017-10-13)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.11...v0.13)

It should be noted that due to a failure in our automation tools, v0.12 was skipped
as a version.

#### Added
* **\[processor\]** The processor now generates a `toString()` if the `@ArezComponent` annotated class has
  not overridden to `Object.toString()` method. It is assumed that if the developer has overridden the
  `Object.toString()` method that they wish to keep that implementation.

#### Changed
* Added `org.realityforge.anodoc:anodoc:jar:1.0.0` as a dependency of the project to replace usage of
  `org.realityforge.arez.Unsupported` and `org.realityforge.arez.annotations.Unsupported` with
  `org.realityforge.anodoc.Unsupported` and `org.jetbrains.annotations.TestOnly` with
  `org.realityforge.anodoc.TestOnly` as easies to enhance and share between other projects.
* Moved dependency on `org.jetbrains:annotations:jar:15.0` to `browser-extras` project as that is the
  only place it continues to be used.
* Upgraded `braincheck` dependency to remove transitive dependency on `org.jetbrains:annotations:jar`.

### [v0.11](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.11) (2017-10-11)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.10...v0.11)

#### Added
* **\[processor\]** Generated component subclasses that are not singletons will now have `equals()` and
  `hashCode()` methods generated based on the component id.

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Add explicit `assert !isDisposed()` statements into generated override methods for `@Observable`,
  `@Autorun`, `@Computed`, `@Tracked` etc. If these methods had been called after the component had been disposed,
  assertion failures would have been but several layers deeper into the system. Lifting the asserts to the user
  accessed entrypoints helps users identify the location of the problem earlier.
* **\[examples\]** The examples in the `examples` project have been converted into integration tests. Each test
  runs through the existing code examples and collects a trace of the events using spy event listeners and compares
  it to fixtures that represent the expected trace.

#### Fixed
* Automate the publishing of releases to Maven Central. Avoids any delay in the artifact being published to Maven
  Central that previously occurred as the process required several manual steps to complete the publishing action.
  The automation runs from TravisCI and publishes to Maven Central any time a tag is created that starts with `v`
  and followed by a number.

### [v0.10](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.10) (2017-10-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.09...v0.10)

#### Fixed
* Fixed several gwt modules that were including too much much in downstream projects. For example the gwt module
  `org.realityforge.arez.Arez` includes all source for any library that was on the classpath as it included the
  path `""` via `<source path=""/>`. Modules have now been updating to only include packages that are in the same
  dependency. The `Dev` suffixed modules have all been updated to include no source as they already include a
  module that includes the required source.

### [v0.09](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.09) (2017-10-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.08...v0.09)

#### Fixed
* Upgraded braincheck library to 1.1.0 to ensure that GWT will remove invariant checks in production mode. A
  change that we were unable to identify resulted in the the invariant checking code being permanently disabled
  but still included but unreferenced in the output javascript.
* **\[core\]** Reworked the way that `ArezConfig` worked so that the settings are resolved at compile time as desired.
* **\[core\]** Reworked the way that `ArezLogger` worked so that the logger is resolved at compile time as desired.

### [v0.08](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.08) (2017-10-08)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.07...v0.08)

#### Added
* **\[doc\]** Started to improve the infrastructure for building documentation. Started to document the basic
  approach for defining Arez components using annotations.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[extras\]** Extracted the `spy` sub-package from gwt module `org.realityforge.arez.extras.Extras` and moved
  it to `org.realityforge.arez.extras.spy.SpyExtras`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[extras\]** Extracted the `spy` sub-package from gwt module `org.realityforge.arez.browser.extras.BrowserExtras`
  and moved it to `org.realityforge.arez.browser.extras.spy.SpyExtras`.

### [v0.07](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.07) (2017-10-05)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.06...v0.07)

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Added several helper methods to `ArezContext` to create actions without specifying mutation parameter.
* **\[processor\]** Introduce several protected access, helper methods that can be used by extensions when writing
  custom queries. Add minimal javadocs to the generated code to help guide extension developers.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Change the return type of generated `findAll` method from a `java.util.Collection` to a
  `java.util.List`. This makes this class consistent with other query methods in the repository. Custom repository
  extensions should no longer use `findAll` to get the entities to query but should instead use the newly added
  method `entities()`
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Introduce a compile time setting `arez.repositories_return_immutables` that can be used to
  make all query methods that return a `List` in generated repositories return an unmodifiable list. This is enable
  by default if you include the `org.realityforge.arez.ArezDev` gwt module.

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Fixed the grammar of invariant failure message in generated repositories when the
  user attempts to destroy an entity that it not in the repository.
* **\[core\]** Fixed a bug where the name of actions were not synthesized for actions created via
  `ArezConfig.safeAction(..)` when a null was passed by `ArezConfig.areNamesEnabled()` returned true.

### [v0.06](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.06) (2017-10-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.05...v0.06)

#### Added
* **\[processor\]** Add an parameter `allowEmpty` to `@ArezComponent` that allows the developer to define
  Arez components without explicitly annotating other elements such as `Observable` annotated methods. This
  is useful if you want to manually manage the creation of Arez elements.

### [v0.05](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.05) (2017-10-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.04...v0.05)

#### Added
* **\[extras\]** Extract the `StringifyReplacer` from the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` class to allow
  subclasses of `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` to control the mechanisms for formatting action parameters.
* **\[annotations\]** Enhanced `@Action` and `@Track` to the ability to disable reporting of the parameters
  to the core runtime infrastructure from the generated components.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[browser-extras\]** Update `BrowserLocation` so that it defaults to calling `preventDefault()` on event
  that triggered hash change. This behaviour can be disabled by invoking `BrowserLocation.setPreventDefault(false)`
  to support old behaviour.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Rename the base repository extension class from `MyComponentRepositoryExtension` to
  `MyComponentBaseRepositoryExtension` as existing downstream projects tend to name their project specific
  extensions using the pattern `MyComponentRepositoryExtension`. (The existing domgen based generators use the
  naming pattern  `MyComponentBaseRepositoryExtension` which is where the new naming pattern was derived from.)
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Rename the method `ActionCompletedEvent.isExpectsResult()` to `ActionCompletedEvent.returnsResult()`
  and update the corresponding serialization in `ActionCompletedEvent.toMap()`
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Restructure action code so the core action and tracker methods are responsible for generating the
  `ActionStartedEvent` and `ActionCompletedEvent` events. To achieve this goal the action and tracker methods
  have all been modified to add an extra varargs argument that is the list of parameters passed to the action.
  Remove all the corresponding infrastructure from the annotation processor.

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Fixed invariant checking in `Transaction` so that `Observable.reportChanged()` can be invoked
  on a dependency of a `ComputedValue` where the `ComputedValue` has already been marked as `POSSIBLY_STALE`.
* **\[processor\]** Fixed the generation of annotated methods that override an annotated method in a parent
  class where the subclass is specialized type of parent class. i.e. If the superclass has a method
  `@Action void foo( T value )` where the `T` type parameter is `<T extends Number>` and the subclass has
  the method `@Action void foo( Integer value )` where the type parameter was resolved to `Integer`, the
  processor would previously generate incorrect code.
* Stop uploading the `examples` and `gwt-examples` artifacts to the distribution repositories.
* **\[core\]** Schedule the "reaction" spy messages after the top-level transaction has completed and sent it's
  corresponding spy message. This means that the `ReactionStartedEvent` and/or `ComputeStartedEvent` will occur
  after the `ActionCompletedEvent` or `ReactionCompletedEvent` that resulted in the reaction/compute being
  scheduled. Thus reactions to an action will be peers of the action in the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor`, making
  it much easier to how changes flow through the system.

### [v0.04](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.04) (2017-10-03)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.03...v0.04)

#### Added
* **\[extras\]** Introduce the `CssRules` annotation to force IntelliJ IDEA to treat annotate content as css
  rules for code formatting, completion and validation purposes. Use this new annotation to annotate relevant
  constants and parameters in the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` class.
* **\[extras\]** Enhance the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` class so that javascript native objects passed as parameters
  to actions are formatted using `JSON.stringify` so that they produce more human friendly messages.
* **\[processor\]** Enhance the `ArezProcessor` to catch unexpected failures and report the crash to the user,
  directing the user to report the failure as a github issue.

#### Changed
* Usage of the invariant checking method call `Guards.invariant(...)` has been replaced by `Guards.apiInvariant(...)`
  in scenarios where the invariant failure is the result of the user of the Arez library supplying invalid data or
  invoking methods before checking whether the elements are in the correct state.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Rename the transaction methods in `ArezContext` that accepted the `Observer` as the tracker to `track`
  or `safeTrack` (depending on whether they throw an exception or not). The methods renamed are specifically:
  - `ArezContext.function(Observer, Function)` renamed to `ArezContext.track(Observer, Function)`
  - `ArezContext.safeFunction(Observer, SafeFunction)` renamed to `ArezContext.safeTrack(Observer, SafeFunction)`
  - `ArezContext.procedure(Observer, Procedure)` renamed to `ArezContext.track(Observer, Procedure)`
  - `ArezContext.safeProcedure(Observer, SafeProcedure)` renamed to `ArezContext.safeTrack(Observer, SafeProcedure)`
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Rename the "action" style transaction methods in `ArezContext` to `action` or `safeAction` (depending
  on whether they throw an exception or not). The methods renamed are specifically:
  - `ArezContext.function(...)` renamed to `ArezContext.action(Observer, Function)`
  - `ArezContext.safeFunction(...)` renamed to `ArezContext.safeAction(Observer, SafeFunction)`
  - `ArezContext.procedure(...)` renamed to `ArezContext.action(Observer, Procedure)`
  - `ArezContext.safeProcedure(...)` renamed to `ArezContext.safeAction(Observer, SafeProcedure)`
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `@Tracked` annotation to `@Track`.

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Annotation processor previously generated catch blocks with the caught exception stored in a
  variable named `e`. This broke code where the action passed e as a parameter. This has been fixed by renaming the
  caught exception to use the standard name mangling used through the rest of the generated code. (i.e. prefixing
  the variable name with `$$arez$$_`)

### [v0.03](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.03) (2017-10-02)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.02...v0.03)

#### Added
* âœ¨ **\[extras\]** Add the Arez component `ObservablePromise` that wraps a javascript native promise
  and exposes the observable properties.
* âœ¨ **\[extras\]** Add the Arez component `IntervalTicker` that "ticks" at a specified interval. The tick
  is actually updating the value of an observable property.
* âœ¨ **\[extras\]** Add the utility class `TimedDisposer` that disposes a target object after a specified
  timeout. Combining this with existing Arez components makes it easy to add timeouts to reactive elements.
* **\[core\]** Added `Disposable.asDisposable(Object)` utility that casts the specified object to a `Disposable`.
* Added automation to site deploy that verifies there are no broken links before uploading website.
* Added a [Motivation](https://arez.github.io/docs/motivation.html) section to the website.
* **\[core\]** Began experimenting with the ability to serialize spy events (i.e. Those in the
  `org.realityforge.arez.spy` package) to `java.util.Map` instances. The goal is to extract and backport
  functionality from several downstream projects including the `example` and `gwt-example` sample projects
  aimed at serializing events. See the `SerializableEvent` interface implemented by all builtin spy events.
* âœ¨ **\[extras\]** Extract a `SpyUtil` class from downstream projects. At this stage it just supports
  determining whether a spy event increases, decreases or does not modify the level of "nesting" in an
  event stream.
* âœ¨ **\[extras\]** Extract the `AbstractSpyEventProcessor` base class from downstream projects. This
  class is intended to make it easy to write tools that process spy events.
* âœ¨ **\[browser-extras\]** Build the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` class. It is a `SpyEventHandler` that
  prints spy events to the browser console in a developer friendly manner.

#### Changed
* **\[core\]** Rename `ArezContext.reaction(...)` methods to `ArezContext.tracker(...)` to reflect their primary
  purpose of creating a tracker to be passed to the transaction methods.

#### Fixed
* Fix the name of the poms generated by the build tool. In v0.02 and earlier the poms had the classifier
  as part of the filename which is incorrect. This has been corrected. i.e. Previously the poms were named
  `arez-core-0.02-gwt.pom` where as now they are named `arez-core-0.03.pom`

### [v0.02](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.02) (2017-09-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.01...v0.02)

#### Added
* Initial support for adding a `@Repository` to an arez component that will cause the generation of a paired
  repository for managing instances of the arez component. Minimal javadocs are available on the site. More
  advanced user documentation is on the way.

### [v0.01](https://github.com/arez/arez/tree/v0.01) (2017-09-27)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/700fa7f3208cb868c4d7d28caf2772e114315d73...v0.01)

Initial alpha release.
