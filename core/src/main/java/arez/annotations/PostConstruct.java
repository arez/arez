/**
 * Annotation to identify method invoked after constructing component.
 * At most 1 method should be annotated with this annotation.
 * The PostConstruct method is invoked after the component classes constructor has been invoked and after all
 * the Arez elements have been constructed and observers (if any) scheduled but before the scheduler has been
 * triggered which would result in the first execution of observers or {@link Computed#keepAlive()} computable
 * values.
 *
 * <p>The method that is annotated with @PostDispose must comply with the additional constraints:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Must not be annotated with any other arez annotation</li>
 * <li>Must have 0 parameters</li>
 * <li>Must not return a value</li>
 * <li>Must not be private</li>
 * <li>Must not be static</li>
 * <li>Must not be abstract</li>
 * <li>Must not throw exceptions</li>
 * </ul>
