[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.09...v0.10)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* Fixed several gwt modules that were including too much much in downstream projects. For example the gwt module
  `org.realityforge.arez.Arez` includes all source for any library that was on the classpath as it included the
  path `""` via `<source path=""/>`. Modules have now been updating to only include packages that are in the same
  dependency. The `Dev` suffixed modules have all been updated to include no source as they already include a
  module that includes the required source.
