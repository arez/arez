[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.23...v0.24)

Changes in this release:

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Remove `disposable` parameter from the `@ArezComponent` annotation as all generated
  components should implement `Disposable`. Not doing so can lead to memory leaks.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Change the default value of the compile time property `arez.logger` to be derived from the
  `arez.environment` setting. If `arez.environment` is `production` then `arez.logger` is set to `jul` and a
  `java.util.Logger` based implementation is used. If `arez.environment` is `development` then a proxy based
  version is used, that is useful during testing. Specify the proeprty in `Arez.gwt.xml` so that GWT compiles
  will treat it as a compile time constant and default it to `jul.`
