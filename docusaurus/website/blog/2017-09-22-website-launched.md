This marks the date when the website was launched. The website marks the time
when the development on the core features of Arez stabilized enough that documenting
the toolkit became viable.

**Features:**

* Basic overview documentation.
* [Javadocs]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/index.html) for the external users of the library.
