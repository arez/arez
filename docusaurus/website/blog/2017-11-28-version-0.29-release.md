[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.28...v0.29)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[core\]** The `ObservableChangedEvent` spy event will now emit the value of the observable if
  property introspectors are enabled and the observable has an accessor introspector.
* **\[browser-extras\]** Enhance the `ConsoleSpyEventProcessor` to log the value field of the
  `ObservableChangedEvent` spy event if it has been supplied.

##### Fixed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** The accessor introspector for `ComputedValue` attempted to recalculate the value when accessing
  value which required that the caller was running a transaction and would cause the caller to observe the
  `ComputedValue`. This differed to normal accessors on `Observable` instances that retrieved the value outside of
  a transaction. The `ComputedValue` was changed to align with the behaviour of normal `Observable` instances and
  will access the current value of the property without trying to recalculate the value.
