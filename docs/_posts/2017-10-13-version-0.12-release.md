[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/arez/compare/v0.11...v0.12)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** The processor now generates a `toString()` if the `@ArezComponent` annotated class has
  not overridden to `Object.toString()` method. It is assumed that if the developer has overridden the
  `Object.toString()` method that they wish to keep that implementation.

##### Changed
* Added `org.realityforge.anodoc:anodoc:jar:1.0.0` as a dependency of the project to replace usage of
  `org.realityforge.arez.Unsupported` and `org.realityforge.arez.annotations.Unsupported` with
  `org.realityforge.anodoc.Unsupported` and `org.jetbrains.annotations.TestOnly` with
  `org.realityforge.anodoc.TestOnly` as easies to enhance and share between other projects.
* Moved dependency on `org.jetbrains:annotations:jar:15.0` to `browser-extras` project as that is the
  only place it continues to be used.
* Upgraded `braincheck` dependency to remove transitive dependency on `org.jetbrains:annotations:jar`.
