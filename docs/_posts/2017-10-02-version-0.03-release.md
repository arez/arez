[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.02...v0.03)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* ✨ **\[extras\]** Add the Arez component [`ObservablePromise`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/browser/extras/ObservablePromise.html)
  that wraps a javascript native promise and exposes the observable properties.
* ✨ **\[extras\]** Add the Arez component [`IntervalTicker`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/browser/extras/IntervalTicker.html)
  that "ticks" at a specified interval. The tick is actually updating the value of an observable property.
* ✨ **\[extras\]** Add the utility class [`TimedDisposer`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/browser/extras/TimedDisposer.html)
  that disposes a target object after a specified timeout. Combining this with existing Arez components
  makes it easy to add timeouts to reactive elements.
* **\[core\]** Added [`Disposable.asDisposable(Object)`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/Disposable.html#asDisposed-java.lang.Object-)
  utility that casts the specified object to a `Disposable`.
* Added automation to site deploy that verifies there are no broken links before uploading website.
* Added a [Motivation](https://arez.github.io/overview/motivation/) section to the website.
* **\[core\]** Began experimenting with the ability to serialize spy events (i.e. Those in the
  `org.realityforge.arez.spy` package) to `java.util.Map` instances. The goal is to extract and backport
  functionality from several downstream projects including the `example` and `gwt-example` sample projects
  aimed at serializing events. See the [`SerializableEvent`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/spy/SerializableEvent.html)
  interface implemented by all builtin spy events.
* ✨ **\[extras\]** Extract a [`SpyUtil`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/extras/spy/SpyUtil.html)
  class from downstream projects. At this stage it just supports determining whether a spy event increases, decreases
  or does not modify the level of "nesting" in an event stream.
* ✨ **\[extras\]** Extract the [`AbstractSpyEventProcessor`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/extras/spy/AbstractSpyEventProcessor.html)
  base class from downstream projects. This class is intended to make it easy to write tools that process spy events.
* ✨ **\[browser-extras\]** Build the [`ConsoleSpyEventProcessor`](https://arez.github.io/api/org/realityforge/arez/browser/extras/spy/ConsoleSpyEventProcessor.html)
  class. It is a `SpyEventHandler` that prints spy events to the browser console in a developer friendly manner.

##### Changed
* **\[core\]** Rename `ArezContext.reaction(...)` methods to `ArezContext.tracker(...)` to reflect their primary
  purpose of creating a tracker to be passed to the transaction methods.

##### Fixed
* Fix the name of the poms generated by the build tool. In v0.02 and earlier the poms had the classifier
  as part of the filename which is incorrect. This has been corrected. i.e. Previously the poms were named
  `arez-core-0.02-gwt.pom` where as now they are named `arez-core-0.03.pom`
