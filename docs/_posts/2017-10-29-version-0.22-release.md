[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.21...v0.22)

Changes in this release:

#### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Add the `@ObserverRef` annotation to allow the reactive component to get access to
  the underling `Observer` instance for either a `@Track` or `@Autorun` annotated method. This is useful for
  framework authors who need access to low level primitives but still want to make use of the arez component
  model.

#### Fixed
* Fixed bug where the annotation processor was not copying the documented annotations from the method annotated
  with the `@ContextRef` annotation to the overriding method in generated subclass.
* Fixed bug where the source code generated for `@Tracked` methods would fail if the `@OnDepsChanged` method
  is protected access and in a different package.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Renamed the `@OnDepsUpdated` annotation to `@OnDepsChanged` to reflect nomenclature
  used through the rest of the toolkit.
