Arez 0.09 released.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/arez/compare/v0.08...v0.09)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* Upgraded braincheck library to 1.1.0 to ensure that GWT will remove invariant checks in production mode. A
  change that we were unable to identify resulted in the the invariant checking code being permanently disabled
  but still included but unreferenced in the output javascript.
* **\[core\]** Reworked the way that `ArezConfig` worked so that the settings are resolved at compile time as desired.
* **\[core\]** Reworked the way that `ArezLogger` worked so that the logger is resolved at compile time as desired.
