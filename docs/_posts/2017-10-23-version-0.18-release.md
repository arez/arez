title: Arez 0.18 released
type: minor

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.17...v0.18)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* Added the class `org.realityforge.arez.ArezTestUtil` that exposes methods that simplify testing `Arez` in
  downstream consumers. It exposes mechanisms already used within the Arez library, that were previously
  restricted to use within Arez.

##### Changed
* **\[core\]** Expose the method `ArezContext.generateNodeName(...)` to make it easier for downstream libraries
  to generate names for reactive components. Update `ArezExtras` class to make use of this method and remove
  local name generation methods.
* **\[processor\]** Enhanced the processor so that disposable entities that are created by a repository will
  be removed from the repository if they are disposed directly by invoking `Disposable.dispose( entity )` or
  similar.
