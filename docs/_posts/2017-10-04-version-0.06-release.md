Arez 0.06 released.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/arez/compare/v0.05...v0.06)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** Add an parameter `allowEmpty` to `@ArezComponent` that allows the developer to define
  Arez components without explicitly annotating other elements such as `Observable` annotated methods. This
  is useful if you want to manually manage the creation of Arez elements.
