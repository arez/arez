[Full Changelog](https://github.com/arez/arez/compare/v0.10...v0.11)

Changes in this release:

#### Added
* **\[processor\]** Generated component subclasses that are not singletons will now have `equals()` and
  `hashCode()` methods generated based on the component id.

#### Changed
* **\[processor\]** Add explicit `assert !isDisposed()` statements into generated override methods for `@Observable`,
  `@Autorun`, `@Computed`, `@Tracked` etc. If these methods had been called after the component had been disposed,
  assertion failures would have been but several layers deeper into the system. Lifting the asserts to the user
  accessed entrypoints helps users identify the location of the problem earlier.
* **\[examples\]** The examples in the `examples` project have been converted into integration tests. Each test
  runs through the existing code examples and collects a trace of the events using spy event listeners and compares
  it to fixtures that represent the expected trace.

#### Fixed
* Automate the publishing of releases to Maven Central. Avoids any delay in the artifact being published to Maven
  Central that previously occurred as the process required several manual steps to complete the publishing action.
  The automation runs from TravisCI and publishes to Maven Central any time a tag is created that starts with `v`
  and followed by a number.
