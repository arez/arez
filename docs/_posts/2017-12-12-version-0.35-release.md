Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** Add a `dagger` parameter to `@ArezComponent` that controls whether a dagger module
  is generated for a component. The default value of parameter is `IF_DETECTED` which will generate a
  dagger module if the component is annotated with a "scope" annotation and the class `dagger.Module`
  is present on the compile path of the annotated class. A "scope" annotation is an annotation that is
  itself annotated with the `javax.inject.Scope` annotation.

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Change the type of the `inject` parameter on the `@ArezComponent` and `@Repository`
  annotations and the `dagger` parameter of the `@Repository` annotation to support `TRUE`, `FALSE` and
  `IF_DETECTED` values. The `IF_DETECTED` value will result in the annotation processor using heuristics
  to determine if the feature is required. See the javadocs for the specific heuristics for each parameter.
