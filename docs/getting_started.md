title: Getting Started
---

Getting started with Arez is not necessarily as it is to start with your average library as it involves
learning to think in a new way. It suggested that you follow these steps to get started:

1.  Read the [conceptual overview](concepts.md). This will give you a basic understanding
    about the core design principles of the toolkit. This will give you enough of the theory
    to get you started.
2.  Read the [component example](component_example.md). This will give you an overview of
    what an Arez component may look like. This should give you a more practical feel for the
    framework.
3.  Look at the source code for the TodoMVC application. This demonstrates what a "real world"
    application looks like. It takes advantage of [React4j](https://react4j.github.io/) to provide
    the web framework and Arez to provide state management. See the [source code](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-todomvc/tree/dagger_maven/src/main/java/react4j/todomvc).
4.  At this stage you should be ready to [set up](project_setup.md) your own project and start
    experimenting.
5.  After you have experimented with the framework it is useful to return and read the reference
    material on this website. This should include reading the API docs where we have attempted to
    provide enough technical details to keep you going.
6.  Most importantly have fun.
