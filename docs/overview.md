Arez is a simple, efficient and scalable state management library for client-side applications. Arez is powered
by the reactive programming model found in spreadsheets, a dataflow programming model. Arez tracks usage of
observable data and notifies observers when the observable data changes. The library scales from simple, flat
domain models to complex, highly inter-connected graph-like domain models. Arez trades a higher memory usage
for a faster execution speed and better developer experience. Arez's optimizes for developer happiness by
eliminating the need to monitor or even think about when state changes and instead react to those changes on
demand.

Anything that can be derived from application state, should be derived from application state. The derivation
should occur automatically and only when it is needed. The application elements such as the user-interface,
network communication, data storage etc. are driven by changes in application state.
