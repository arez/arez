title: IntelliJ IDEA IDE Setup
---

IntelliJ IDEA is the IDE that the authors of Arez use and recommend but any IDE should work fine. It
is however the only IDE that the authors have experience with when tuning the configuration.

## Configure the Annotation Processors

IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2 does not correctly setup annotation processors when importing a `pom.xml` if the
annotation processor jar is not also present on the compile path. So it is necessary to manually configure
the annotation processors.

This involves opening up the `Settings` or `Preferences` dialog which is accessed through the
menu `IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences` under Mac OSX or `File -> Settings` under Linux and Windows.
Then go to `Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors` and configure
the `Processor Path` to include the path to the annotation processor jar.

## Enable Auto Build

If your project is small enough or your processor is fast enough it is also useful to enable
automatic annotation processing. As before you can open up the preferences dialog and go to
`Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler` and enable `"Make project automatically"`. And then
open the Action window:

* Linux: `CTRL+SHIFT+A`
* MacOS: `SHIFT+COMMAND+A`
* Windows: `CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+/`

Enter `Registry...` and enable `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running`.

## Add Generated Source to Path

The Arez annotation processors generate source code and it is useful to tell the IDE to add this source
code to each module. After this is done the IDE will allow auto completion and enable intellisense
for the generated code which can be a significant development aid. To do this go to
`File -> Project Structure -> Module -> [MyModule] -> Sources` and add the generated directory as `Sources`.

Note: You will receive a warning when the project compiles that this directory was excluded but
do not worry as that is what we expect and want.
