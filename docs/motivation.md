## Managing State is Hard

Managing state can be hard. When state changes it can be difficult to know which parts of the view needs to be
updated, and/or which processes need to be modified and/or cancelled.

Consider the relatively simple process of adding a product to shopping cart in a web application. This action
may trigger the following activities:

* adding a row to a HTML table to contain details about the item.
* updating an item count.
* updating the amount left on a voucher (if any).
* updating the subtotal if the voucher reaches $0.
* initiating an asynchronous process to check availability of the item.
* initiating an asynchronous process to retrieve product details.
* initiating an asynchronous process to retrieve product image.

If the user then decides to remove the item from the shopping cart then the activities need to be reversed and
the asynchronous processes need to be cancelled. These activities may be interleaved with other updates that are
triggered by other user activities or other asynchronous processes completing (i.e. a network request is returned).

Even for this very simple domain, the complexity of the code required to achieve correct or even just
"good enough" state management can be significant.

## Managing State in Arez

The goal of Arez is to eliminate the complexity around managing state.

In an Arez web application, the view is considered a derivation of the application state. This includes all
state that is considered important enough to manage. In a typically application this includes any dynamic data
that is presented on a page, the current url, the state of UI controls (be they pagination controls, form
controls, spinners) etc. Non-view components of a web application should also be derived from the application
state. It would not be unusual to have the WebSocket connections to backend services derived from application
state.

In Arez, the way that the view is modified is to update the the application state and let the view react to
the changes. The view will be notified that the state has been updated and will update itself to reflect the
current state. When the view is purely a projection of the application state, the update process is relatively
easy to implement.

In some scenarios it is useful to derive a value once and use it multiple locations. i.e. In the
shopping cart example, the total value of the goods in the shopping cart may be used to calculate the amount
left on the voucher and the subtotal. Arez has the ability to cache this derive value and only recalculate it
if it becomes stale.
