Arez is a relatively new toolkit but there are some other resources and related projects.
This list will hopefully grap over time. Feel free to submit a pull request to add new projects
to this page.

* [arez-browserlocation](https://github.com/arez/arez-browserlocation) A browser-based Arez component
  that makes the hash component of the browser location reactive.

* [arez-idlestatus](https://github.com/arez/arez-idlestatus) A browser-based Arez component that tracks
  when the user is idle. A user is considered idle if they have not interacted with the browser for a
  specified amount of time.

* [arez-networkstatus](https://github.com/arez/arez-networkstatus) A browser-based Arez component that
  tracks when the user is "online". The online state is essentially a reflection of the browsers
  "navigator.onLine" value.

* [arez-promise](https://github.com/arez/arez-promise) A GWT/Javascript based Arez component that
  wraps a Promise and exposes observable state that tracks the state of the promise.

* [arez-spytools](https://github.com/arez/arez-spytools) This library provides additional utilities and
  introspection tools based on the core Arez spy infrastructure.

* [arez-ticker](https://github.com/arez/arez-ticker) This library provides an Observable model that "ticks"
  at a specified interval. The tick is actually updating the "tickTime" observable property.

* [arez-timeddisposer](https://github.com/arez/arez-timeddisposer) This library provides a utility class
  that will dispose a target object after a time delay.

* [react4j](https://github.com/react4j/react4j) React4j is *'...an opinionated react java binding'* that allows
  you to write a web frontend using the react component model but writing the components in Java. The project
  has comprehensive support for Arez based react components. The Arez react4j components track which are properties
  are accessed when the component is rendered and will automatically reschedule the react4j component for
  re-rendering if the properties change.
