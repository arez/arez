Arez is a relatively new toolkit but there are some other resources and related projects.
This list will hopefully grow over time. Feel free to submit a pull request to add new projects
to this page.

* [arez-persist](https://github.com/arez/arez-persist) This library provides annotation driven
  infrastructure for persisting observable properties on Arez components.

* [react4j](https://github.com/react4j/react4j) React4j is *'...an opinionated react java binding'* that allows
  you to write a web frontend using the react component model but writing the components in Java. The project
  has comprehensive support for Arez based react components. The Arez react4j components track which are properties
  are accessed when the component is rendered and will automatically reschedule the react4j component for
  re-rendering if the properties change.
