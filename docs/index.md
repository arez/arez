Arez is designed to be a simple, efficient and scalable state management library for client-side
applications that shines no matter how complex the relationships between elements within the system.
Arez trades memory for efficiency, execution efficiency and developer efficiency. Arez avoids costly
reactions to state changes such as re-rendering views unless the underlying data actually changes and
the view needs to be re-rendered. Arez also optimizes for developer efficiency by eliminating the need
for the developer to monitor or even think about when state changes and instead react to those changes
on demand.
